title: Brighten up your terminal with LS_COLORS

The self-descriptive `LS_COLORS` is an environment variable that defines how
the ubiquitous `ls` shell utility displays your terminal's colors when called
with the `--color` flag. I recently found out about it while reading the man
page for the `tree` command.

The variable itself is a comma delimited list of key-value pairs.
Unfortunately, official documentation is scant around what each key is (or even
what the possible keys are), but in [this post][bartman] Bartman explains the
meaning of many of the keys and how to set them.

You can tinker with the key value pairs yourself, or get started with the
LS_COLORS project on [GitHub][ls_colors] that includes color definitions for
about 300 different filetypes (side note: a 785 line shell script is definitely
the longest environment variable definition I've seen).

Below are some screenshots.

`ls --colors` with `LS_COLORS` unset:

and with the `LS_COLORS` from GitHub:

Hope you enjoy your new jazzed up `ls`!
