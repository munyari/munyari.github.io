I was watching a [lecture][lecture] from [MIT's 8.04][804] (because physics is
cool), when I ran across this excellent quote from Heisenberg about wave
particle duality:

> The solution of the difficulty is that the two mental pictures which
experiment lead us to form - the one of the particles, the other of the
waves - are both incomplete and have only the validity of analogies
which are accurate only in limiting cases. […]
Light and matter are both single entities, and the apparent duality
arises in the limitations of our language. It is not surprising that our
language should be incapable of describing the processes occurring
within the atoms, for, as has been remarked, it was invented to describe
the experiences of daily life, and these consist only of processes
involving exceedingly large numbers of atoms. Furthermore, it is very
difficult to modify our language so that it will be able to describe
these atomic processes, for words can only describe things of which we
can form mental pictures, and this ability, too, is a result of daily
experience. Fortunately, mathematics is not subject to this limitation,
and it has been possible to invent a mathematical scheme — the quantum
theory — which seems entirely adequate for the treatment of atomic
processes; for visualisation, however, we must content ourselves with
two incomplete analogies — the wave picture and the corpuscular
picture.

Googling around seems to indicate that this is from *The Physical Principles of
the Quantum Theory* (please correct me if you know better). As an aside the
lecturer, Allan Adams, is fantastic so far.
