# Purposeful practice<a id="orgheadline4"></a>

## Purposeful practice has well-defined, specific goals<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

-   Each practice session has a measurable goal, a metric which the practice session is focused on.
-   It is not aimed at some vague, overall improvement.
-   There is **no such thing** as developing general skills.

## Purposeful practice is focused<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

-   It requires the practitioner's full attention.
-   Avoid distractions like the plague. Look for anything that might distract you and find ways to limit their influence. Block internet access, and put away or switch off your phone.

> It is better to train at 100 percent effort for less time than at 70 percent
> effort for a longer period. Once you find that you can no longer focus, end the
> session.

## Purposeful practice requires getting out of one's comfort zone<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

-   It requires trying to do something that you couldn't do before
-   when you face barriers, learn to approach them from a different direction

> Remember: if your mind is wandering or you're relaxed and just having fun, you
> probably won't improve.

# Deliberate practice<a id="orgheadline10"></a>

## Deliberate practice is purposeful practice with a few extra steps<a id="orgheadline5"></a>

Deliberate practice develops skills that others have already figured out how to do and for which effective training techniques have been established. The practice regimen should be designed and overseen by a teacher or coach who is familiar with the abilities of expert performers

## Deliberate practice is both purposeful and *informed*<a id="orgheadline7"></a>

> Deliberate practice is informed and guided by the best performers' accomplishments and by
> understanding of what these expert performers do to excel.

### Find a coach<a id="orgheadline6"></a>

-   Once you have reached a level greater than any of the coach's prior students and you seem to have stagnated, move on to better coaches.
-   While true deliberate practice requires the guidance of a teacher or coach, it can be emulated by identifying expert performers and recognizing what sets them apart. The goal is to develop appropriate training techniques to make you an expert too.

## Deliberate practice involves feedback<a id="orgheadline8"></a>

The quicker your feedback cycle, the better. Feedback may be from a teacher,
internal (see the section on mental representations) or some other source.
Regardless of it's source, it is vitally important to the process. It is equally
important that you modify your efforts in response to the feedback.

## Deliberate practice involves building or modifying previously acquired skills<a id="orgheadline9"></a>

by focusing on particular aspects of those skills and working to improve them
specifically. As stated previously, deliberate practice is a process of specific
skill acquisition, there is not much to be gained by trying to improve "general"
skills.

# Planning<a id="orgheadline31"></a>

## Understand what belies expert performance in the field<a id="orgheadline18"></a>

### Identify the best in the field and distill their training techniques<a id="orgheadline11"></a>

An example given is Benjamin Franklin modeling his style of writing on that of
writers at a local newspaper that he loved.

### Observe the performance of expert performers<a id="orgheadline13"></a>

Can you build mental representations of yourself performing at a similar or higher level?

1.  your observations should be active rather than passive

    Ask "What exactly allowed this person to perform well in this field? How can I emulate it?"

### Gain an understanding of what skills really matter<a id="orgheadline14"></a>

Once you have identified experts, identify what makes them different from others
that could explain superior performance. Beware of red herrings, e.g. experts
who believe that they owe their expertise to superstition/spirituality.

### Don't let hidden biases affect your view or experts<a id="orgheadline17"></a>

Make sure not to be swayed by factors such as age, race, sex, education,
recognition, friendliness and attractiveness when judging another person's
overall competence and expertise. Consider the following questions:

1.  who is highly regarded by their peers?

    Seek out the persons that professionals themselves seek out when they need help
    with a particularly difficult situation. Any such individual is not just
    needlessly hyped.

2.  Can you leverage your domain knowledge?

    In a field that you're familiar with, think carefully about what characterises
    good performance and try to come up with ways to measure that, even if there
    must be a certain amount of subjectivity in your measurement. Then look for
    those people who score highest in the areas you believe are key to superior
    performance.

## Plan your practice<a id="orgheadline24"></a>

### Consistency is key<a id="orgheadline19"></a>

Set aside a regular time in your schedule for practice. Mornings may be a good
time for this. Dr. Ericsson recommends at least an hour of deliberate practice
every day. Identifying a specific period as practice time creates a sense of
habit and duty.

### Specifically designate deliberate practice time as such<a id="orgheadline20"></a>

Having a time blocked off for deliberate practice makes it less likely that
you'll end up just going through the motions.

### Plan leisure, as well as practice time<a id="orgheadline21"></a>

It's useful to know exactly how much time you spend on different activities. A
better understanding of this allows you to make better plans: plans that you are
more likely to fulfill. This is not saying that you have to necessarily limit
your leisure time in any way, only to understand how you allocate your time.

### Identify an aspect of performance you wish to improve<a id="orgheadline22"></a>

Make sure you know what aspect of performance you are trying to improve, so you
don't just go around in circles.

### Build your mental representation with visualization and meditation<a id="orgheadline23"></a>

Have a clear mental model of what a successful practice would look and feel like.
This goes hand in hand with having a clear objective for each training session.

## Craft a focused step-by-step plan for improvement.<a id="orgheadline26"></a>

### Break goals down into smaller intermediate goals<a id="orgheadline25"></a>

> One of the best bits of advice is to set things up so that you are constantly
> seeing concrete signs of improvement, even if it is not always a major
> improvement. Break your long journey into a manageable series of goals and focus
> on them one at a time - perhaps even giving yourself a small reward each time
> you reach a goal.

## Build mental representations<a id="orgheadline30"></a>

### Effective mental representations improve acquisition of new knowledge and skill<a id="orgheadline27"></a>

The more you study a subject, the more detailed your mental representations of
it become, and the better you get at assimilating new information.

### Effective mental representations allow better planning<a id="orgheadline28"></a>

-   A practitioner with a better mental representation has a more intuitive understanding of the parameters of performance, and is better able to detect her own mistakes. Thus, the practitioner becomes better at self-reflection.
-   Monitor and evaluate performance, and modify mental representations to make them more effective.

### Effective mental representations improve self-feedback<a id="orgheadline29"></a>

A better understanding of the problem domain will allow you to have a better
mental representation. In this way, better mental representations facilitate
improved self-feedback.

# Execution<a id="orgheadline33"></a>

## Keep practice intensely focused<a id="orgheadline32"></a>

Once focus begins to wane, cut your session short and take a break, or call it a
day. You'll probably have to take about one break for every hour of intense
concentration.

# Measurement<a id="orgheadline35"></a>

## Keep performance and practice metrics<a id="orgheadline34"></a>

Well selected, objective metrics that are related to your performance will tell
you where you are doing well and where you need to improve.

# Reflection<a id="orgheadline36"></a>

-   After every practice session, ask what you did right and what could have been better. Interrogate every aspect of your performance
-   Build a mental representation of how practice would have gone ideally, and make a plan to remove barriers to this idealised practice session

# Other<a id="orgheadline42"></a>

## Perseverance<a id="orgheadline37"></a>

Don't give up. Not much else to say.

> &#x2026; what distinguished the most successful spellers was their superior ability
> to remain committed to studying despite the boredom and the pull of other, more
> appealing activities.

## Dealing with plateus<a id="orgheadline39"></a>

-   Similar to strength sports, allow some variation in your routine. If you're stagnating in one skill, find a related skill that is lagging and work on that.

### Identify what exactly is holding you back<a id="orgheadline38"></a>

> What mistakes are you making, and when? Push yourself well outside of your
> comfort zone and see what breaks down first. Then design a practice technique
> aimed at improving that particular weakness

## Find/create a supportive environment<a id="orgheadline40"></a>

> Put together a group of people all interested in the same thing - or join an
> exisiting group - and use the group's camaraderie and shared goals as extra
> motivation in reaching your own goals

## Make sure to get enough sleep, and rest/leisure in general<a id="orgheadline41"></a>

Don't be awaken by alarm clocks, try to wake up unassisted at the end of your
sleep cycle.
