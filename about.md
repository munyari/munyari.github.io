Welcome to my blog! My name is Panashe Fundira, I'm from Harare, Zimbabwe, and
I'm currently a junior at Manhattanville College. I'm majoring in
Mathematics and Computer Science. I've written programs in a few languages, but
Ruby's my current favorite. I'm mainly interested in cryptography and web
development, but I'm fascinated by computer science and software engineering
more broadly, and I think I've only begun to scratch the surface in that regard.

I'm currently working on my first "real" web app in Ruby on Rails and a research
project in theoretical physics that will hopefully culminate in a publication
(if only my high school physics teacher could see me now). I'm also trying to
dream up some worthwhile projects for my senior theses.

This summer I will be at the [Recurse Center][recurse] in New York.

Apart from programming, I enjoy rugby, good beer (nothing like a great IPA),
juicy steaks, and strength sports. My [wilks score][wilks] is ~~319~~ 324.
