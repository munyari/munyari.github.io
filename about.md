Welcome to my blog! My name is Panashe Fundira, I'm from Harare, Zimbabwe, and
I'm currently a senior at Manhattanville College. I'm majoring in
Economics, Mathematics and Computer Science. I've been cultivating my interest
in machine learning, and am currently working on a project to apply deep
learning to the identification of early-stage cancerous lesions.

I'm also currently working on a research project in theoretical physics around
the concept of [naturalness][wiki] that will hopefully culminate in a
publication (if only my high school physics teacher could see me now).

[wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalness_(physics)

I spent the summer of 2016 at the [Recurse Center][recurse] in New York, and it
was one of the most enjoyable periods of my short life. I highly recommend the
Recurse Center community to all programmers.

In the summer of 2017, I will be joining Dropbox as a Software Engineer.

Apart from programming, I enjoy rugby, good beer (nothing like a great IPA),
juicy steaks, and strength sports. My [wilks score][wilks] is ~~319~~ 324.
